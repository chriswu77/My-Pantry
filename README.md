## Motivation <a name="motivation"/>
My inspiration for this app was pretty straightforward. I wanted to know what I could make from my pantry.

My Pantry is a food web app that provides available recipes based on a user's available ingredients. A user can sign up and create an account. Then they can search for ingredients and then add them to their ingredients list. They will be able to view available recipes based on their saved list and also be able to save individual recipes to their favorites.

FYI: This project is still a work in progress. The UI is not fully fleshed out yet, but everything else is good to go.
